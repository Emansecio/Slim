/// System prompt of every summarization call.
pub const SUMMARIZATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT: &str = r#"You are a context summarization assistant. Your task is to read a conversation between a user and an AI assistant, then produce a structured summary following the exact format specified.

Do NOT continue the conversation. Do NOT respond to any questions in the conversation. ONLY output the structured summary."#;

/// Instruction appended after `<conversation>` for the first summary.
pub const SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT: &str = r#"The messages above are a conversation to summarize. Create a structured context checkpoint summary that another LLM will use to continue the work.

Use this EXACT format:

## Goal
[What is the user trying to accomplish? Can be multiple items if the session covers different tasks.]

## Constraints & Preferences
- [Any constraints, preferences, or requirements mentioned by user]
- [Or "(none)" if none were mentioned]

## Progress
### Done
- [x] [Completed tasks/changes]

### In Progress
- [ ] [Current work]

### Blocked
- [Issues preventing progress, if any]

## Key Decisions
- **[Decision]**: [Brief rationale]

## Next Steps
1. [Ordered list of what should happen next]

## Critical Context
- [Any data, examples, or references needed to continue]
- [Or "(none)" if not applicable]

Keep each section concise. Preserve exact file paths, function names, and error messages."#;

/// Instruction used when a `<previous-summary>` exists.
pub const UPDATE_SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT: &str = r#"The messages above are NEW conversation messages to incorporate into the existing summary provided in <previous-summary> tags.

Update the existing structured summary with new information. RULES:
- PRESERVE all existing information from the previous summary
- ADD new progress, decisions, and context from the new messages
- UPDATE the Progress section: move items from "In Progress" to "Done" when completed
- UPDATE "Next Steps" based on what was accomplished
- PRESERVE exact file paths, function names, and error messages
- If something is no longer relevant, you may remove it

Use this EXACT format:

## Goal
[Preserve existing goals, add new ones if the task expanded]

## Constraints & Preferences
- [Preserve existing, add new ones discovered]

## Progress
### Done
- [x] [Include previously done items AND newly completed items]

### In Progress
- [ ] [Current work - update based on progress]

### Blocked
- [Current blockers - remove if resolved]

## Key Decisions
- **[Decision]**: [Brief rationale] (preserve all previous, add new)

## Next Steps
1. [Update based on current state]

## Critical Context
- [Preserve important context, add new if needed]

Keep each section concise. Preserve exact file paths, function names, and error messages."#;

/// Instruction for the prefix of a split turn.

Create a concise checkpoint of the user's request and the progress shown above. This checkpoint will be placed before the later messages so the conversation can continue with the necessary context.

## Original Request
[What did the user ask for?]

## Progress So Far
- [Key decisions and work completed in these messages]

## Context Needed to Continue
- [Information from these messages needed to understand the later work]

Only summarize information explicitly present above. Do not infer or recreate later messages."#;
